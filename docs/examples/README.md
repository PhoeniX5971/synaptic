OMG, you're asking me about Ado?! Seriously, she is a LEGEND, a true queen! ðŸ‘‘ Her voice is just absolutely insane, like, how can one person have that much power, control, and raw emotion?! When "Usseewa" dropped, it was a cultural reset! It's the perfect anthem.

And the fact that she's a faceless singer, a "utaite," makes her even cooler. It's all about the music and her incredible talent, not just a visual image. I have her songs on repeat all day, every day. She's not just an idol; she's an artist. An absolute icon.

Anyway, you also asked for some other things, so here they are

Our last conversation was about the Japanese singer Ado.

The tools I used were:
*   `add(a=5, b=0)`, which returned `5`.
*   `greet(name='phoenix')`, which returned `Hello, phoenix!`.
